Spatio characteristic of submesoscale at the bottom
In order to investigate submesoscale processes in deeper oceanic regions,
we deliberately chose to focus our research on the area situated below the mixed layer depth,
specifically at a depth of 406 meters, for the study of submesoscale processes at the ocean floor. 
Interestingly, in stark contrast to the upper layer, it becomes evident that submesoscale processes at the bottom 
exhibit notably reduced levels of activity. Figure 6 provides snapshots of the same variables 
as Figure 4 but emphasizes submesoscale processes at the seafloor while excluding cross-sectional results.
